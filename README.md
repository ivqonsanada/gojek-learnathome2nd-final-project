# Gojek #learnathhome Final Project

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). So you can use basic react-scripts command carried by it.

## How to use

1. Copy .env.example as .env

```properties
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Get [Zomato API KEY](https://developers.zomato.com/api) then pass it to .env variable REACT_APP_ZOMATO_API_KEY. It will look like this:

```properties
REACT_APP_ZOMATO_API_KEY=1n1h4ny45eb4g41c0nt0h4p1k3ysaj4
```

3. Do npm start as usual

```properties
npm start
```
